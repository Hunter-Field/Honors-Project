# Honors-Project

This project calculates the cheapest option for driving to a store and getting an item. This project was created for my ECE 264 Honors Assignment.

The code takes in the price of gas and a cars gas milage from one file. From a second file, it also takes in any number of stores, their item price, and distance away in miles.
